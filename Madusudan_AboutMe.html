   <p>Hi. My name is Akhil Madusudan and I am a freshman at Dublin High School.
Throughout my life, I have overcome many obstacles and struggles by being resourceful and disciplined. I use these skills to excel in whatever I put my mind too which mean being dedicated and staying focused. Being responsible and dedicated is a need for me and my life, especially in my pursuit of becoming a software engineer. My goal is to graduate from college with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. After achieving this, I also plan on working for a great company and pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science. Software engineering lets me use all my exceptional skills to test new things and find solutions to problems. It is the best job for the unique qualities that I possess. 
Having the best and most effective skills is extremely important to me like being responsible and intelligent. One of my best qualities is being able to brainstorm and engineer solutions to solve problems. These skill sets were used when I won 1st place in the Science Innovation Fair in Dougherty Elementary School. I have also thrived by being a leader and knowing how to manage situations without any bad outcomes. 
I am also great respecting other co-workers and being social. Respect is needed when working with other people. People will be able to be comfortable and trust me, which will ensure a excellent work environment wherever I am. With these superior skills I have accomplished being a person that is known to be nice and social with a good reputation. I have won many rewards such as the “Role Model” award in 8th grade at Questa Middle School.
 My life has helped me discover different skills and talents such as being a leader and analyzing problems to help me on my path to a great career. I have been taught the importance of using my skills to help me prosper and succeed as an individual. Please feel free to contact to me if you have any questions and explore this site to find out about my interests, achievements, and more. </p>
